This is where certain scripts and commands will be listed. NOTE: If you are the actual originator or author of something here, please let me know so I can provide proper contributions. I pull alot from others and online, so I am bound to copy someone's technique by accident. that said, if you state that the command 'rm -rf / . ' or similar is yours, Ima ignore you......
